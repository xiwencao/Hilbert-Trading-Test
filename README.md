## INTRO TO FUNDING RATES
Funding rates are periodical cash flows exchanged between long- and short-position holders. The absolute amount per lot will be based on the difference between the perpetual futures and index prices.  
Unlike traditional futures, perpetual futures contracts have no expiration date. Traders can hold their positions perpetually unless they are liquidated. To ensure perpetual contractsâ€™ prices correspond to their underlying markets, crypto exchanges created a mechanism known as funding rate.  
The interest rate and the premium determines the funding rates.
